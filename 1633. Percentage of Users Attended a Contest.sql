Table: Users

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| user_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a user.
 

Table: Register

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| contest_id  | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
 

Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.

Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.


SOLUTION:


SELECT  R.contest_id, ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT R.user_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage
FROM Register  R
GROUP BY R.contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, R.contest_id ASC;
